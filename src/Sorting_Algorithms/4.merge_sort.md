The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. In other words, it divides the original array into smaller arrays until each small array has only one position, then it merges the smaller arrays into a bigger one that is sorted.

The implementation here is recursive and consists of two functions, one to divide the arrays into smaller ones and one to perform the sort:

Here's a diagram to visualize the process:
