The quick sort is one of the most used sorting algorithm. Similar to the merge sort, the quick sort also uses the divide-and-conquer approach. Let's break the process down into steps to understand it a little better since it's a bit more complex than the previous sorts we've covered:

1. Select a value from the array that we will call pivot, generally the value at the middle of the array.
2. Perform the partition operation which will result in an array with values lesser than the pivot on the left and greater on the right.
3. Repeat the first two steps for each subarray (left and right) until the arrays are completely sorted.
