Graphs, sometimes known as networks, refer to sets of nodes with linkages (or edges). We can further divide graphs into two groups (i.e. directed graphs and undirected graphs), according to whether the linkages have direction. We use graphs in our daily lives without even realizing it. Graphs help calculate the best route in navigation apps or recommend friends with whom we might like to connect.

# ADJACENCY MATRIX
Adjacency matrix shows nodes in rows and columns. Intersections of the row and column interpret the relationship between nodes: 0 means not linked, 1 means linked and >1 means different weightage.

To query for nodes in a graph, one must search through the entire tree network with either the breadth-first-search (BFS) method or the depth-first-search (DFS) method.
