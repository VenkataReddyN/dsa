Stack follows the principle of LIFO (last In, first out). If you stack books, the top book will be taken before the bottom one. When you browse on the internet, the back button leads you to the most recently browsed page.

``` 
COMMON METHODS OF STACK IN JAVASCRIPT
push: Input a new element.
pop : Remove the top element, return the removed element.
peek : Return the top element.
length : Return the number of element(s) in the stack.```

Array in JavaScript has the attributes of a stack, but we construct a stack from scratch by using function Stack().
