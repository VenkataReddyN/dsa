![Hash table](https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/6_javascript-data-structures.png)

A hash table is a key-value data structure. Due to the lightning speed of querying a value through a key, hash tables are commonly used in map, dictionary or object data structures. As shown in the graph above, the hash table uses a hash function to convert keys into a list of numbers, and these numbers serve as the values of corresponding keys. To get value using a key is fast; time complexity can achieve O(1). The same keys must return the same values, which is the basis of the hash function.
