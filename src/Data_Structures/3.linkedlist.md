![Linkedlist](https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/3_javascript-data-structures.png)

A linked list is a chained data structure. Each node consists of two pieces of information: the data of the node and the pointer to the next node. Linked list and conventional array are both linear data structures with serialized storage. Of course, they also have differences:

|Comparison|Array|Linked List| 
|----|-----|-------|
|Memory allocation|Static memory allocation,happends during compiling and sequential|Dynamic memory allocation,happens during running and non-sequential|
|Get elements|Read from index,faster in speed|Read through all node in queue until get the specific element,slower in speed|
|Add/Delete elements|Due to sequential and static memory,slower in speed|Due to dynamic allocation, only require minor memory overhead,faster in speed|
|Spatial structure|1.dimension or multi-dimension|Unilateral/bilateral, or circular linked list|

```
UNILATERAL LINKED LIST METHODS
size: Return the number of node(s).
head: Return the element of the head.
add: Add another node in the tail.
remove: Remove a certain node.
indexOf: Return the index of a node.
elementAt: Return the node of an index.
addAt: Insert a node at a specific index.
removeAt: Delete a node at a specific index.
