Trie (pronounced “try”) or “prefix tree” is also a type of search tree. Trie stores the data step-by-step; each node in the tree represents a step. We use trie to store vocabulary so it can be quickly searched, especially for an auto-complete function.

Each node in trie has an alphabet and following the branch can form a complete word. It also comprises a boolean indicator to show whether or not it’s the end of a string.
